# Ovee starter

To scaffold the project use this commands:

```bash
degit owlsdepartment/ovee-starter my-project

cd my-project
# isntall dependencies
yarn
yarn dev # or serve
```

## Tips

 - You can replace `yarn` with `npm`, but remember to delete `yarn.lock` as it is not recommended to keep them both.
 - `jsconfig.json` is only for VS Code compatibility. Feel free to delete it, if you don't need it
